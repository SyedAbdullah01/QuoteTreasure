## API

QuoteTreasure uses an external API to fetch quotes. The API used in this project is available [here](https://jacintodesign.github.io/quotes-api/data/quotes.json).

## Customizing Styling

You can customize the styling of QuoteTreasure by modifying the HTML classes directly in the `index.html` file. Feel free to experiment with the classes to achieve the look and feel that suits your preferences.

Please note that while you can customize styling this way, it's recommended to follow best practices and consider providing a separate CSS file for production if you want to ensure a polished and efficient design. This can be achieved by writing custom CSS and linking it to the HTML file.
